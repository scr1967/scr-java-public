# JDBC Utilities 

A set of utility classes for performing basic CRUD opperations dynamically against a table in any JDBC database.
This is not an ORM utility. It doesn't map a table to a class. It does allow select/insert/update/delete operations on any table in a JDBC database, provided access to those operations have been granted.
